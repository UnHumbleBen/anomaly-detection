# anomaly-detection
Using an anomaly detection algorithm to detect anomalous behavior in server computers.
The features measure the throughput (mb/s) and latency (ms) of response for each server.

We use a Guassian model to detect anomalous examples in the dataset. We start on a
2D dataset for visualization purposes. We fit a Guassian distribution on the dataset and find values 
that have low probability and hence can be considered anomalities.
After that, we apply the anomaly detection algorithm to a larger datset
with many dimensions. Below is the visualization of the 2D dataset.
