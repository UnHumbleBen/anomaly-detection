function p = multivariateGuassian(X, mu, Sigma2)
%MULTIVARIATEGUASSIAN Computes the probability density
%function of the multivariate guassian distribution
%   p = MULTIVARIATEGUASSIAN(X, mu Sigma2) Computes the probability
%   density function of the examples X under the multivariate
%   guassian distribution with parameters mu and Sigma2. If Sigma2 is a 
%   matrix, it is treated as the covariance matrix. If Sigma2 is a vector,
%   it is treated as the sigma^2 values of the variances in each
%   dimension (a diagonal covariance matrix)
